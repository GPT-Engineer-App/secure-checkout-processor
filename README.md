# secure-checkout-processor

The provided PHP code outlines a WordPress plugin named Secure Checkout Plugin. It's designed to securely transmit cart details and payment information to an external payment processor while ensuring the delivery address remains confidential. The plugin defines a custom REST API endpoint within WordPress to handle the payment processing. Key features include:

- A custom REST Controller `Secure_Checkout_Controller` extending `WP_REST_Controller`.
- A namespace and rest base for the API endpoint, allowing for the processing of payments via a specific URL.
- The `register_routes` method defines the API endpoint and specifies the HTTP method, callback function, permission callback, and arguments.
- The `permissions_check` method, where permissions for accessing the endpoint can be specified.
- The `process_payment` method handles the logic for decrypting the delivery address, processing payment without revealing the address to the payment processor, and storing order details.
- Helper methods for decrypting data and interacting with the payment processor.

The code is structured to allow for secure communication and data handling within a WordPress environment, leveraging WordPress's REST API capabilities.
